# Grafana Firebase Admin Data Source Backend Plugin

This plugin adds Firebase Admin datasource that is using Firebase Admin SDK to query Firebase Auth data. Datasource simply calls `client.Users()` to fetch users data and returns user fields:
- UID
- Display name
- Email
- Phone number

For the datasource to work, you need to provide [JSON containing SA key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) which is needed by Firebase Admin SDK.

## What is Grafana Data Source Backend Plugin?

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

For more information about backend plugins, refer to the documentation on [Backend plugins](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/).

## Getting started

A data source backend plugin consists of both frontend and backend components.

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

### Backend

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Build backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin:

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

3. List all available Mage targets for additional commands:

   ```bash
   mage -l
   ```
